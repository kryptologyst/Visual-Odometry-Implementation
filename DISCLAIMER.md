# DISCLAIMER

## WARNING: EDUCATIONAL AND RESEARCH USE ONLY

This Visual Odometry implementation is provided for **educational and research purposes only**. 

### DO NOT USE ON REAL ROBOTS

**This software is NOT suitable for real-world deployment on actual robots without:**

1. **Expert Review**: Professional robotics engineers must review and validate the code
2. **Safety Measures**: Proper safety systems, emergency stops, and fail-safes must be implemented
3. **Extensive Testing**: Thorough testing in controlled environments with safety protocols
4. **Hardware Validation**: Verification on actual hardware with proper calibration
5. **Real-time Guarantees**: This implementation does not provide real-time performance guarantees

### LIMITATIONS AND RISKS

- **No Real-time Guarantees**: Performance may vary and is not optimized for real-time operation
- **Limited Error Handling**: Insufficient error handling for safety-critical scenarios
- **No Collision Avoidance**: Does not include obstacle detection or collision avoidance
- **Simulation Only**: Designed for simulation environments, not real-world conditions
- **No Safety Systems**: Lacks safety-critical features required for real robot operation
- **Uncalibrated Sensors**: Uses default camera parameters, not real sensor calibration
- **No Emergency Stops**: No emergency stop or safety shutdown mechanisms

### INTENDED USE CASES

This software is intended for:
- Academic research and education
- Algorithm development and testing
- Simulation-based experiments
- Learning Visual Odometry concepts
- Benchmarking and comparison studies

### LIABILITY

The authors and contributors:
- **DISCLAIM ALL LIABILITY** for any damage, injury, or loss resulting from the use of this software
- **DO NOT WARRANT** the fitness of this software for any particular purpose
- **RECOMMEND** that users implement proper safety measures before any real-world application

### SAFETY RECOMMENDATIONS

If you intend to use this code as a basis for real robot applications:

1. **Implement Safety Systems**: Add emergency stops, velocity limits, and collision detection
2. **Add Error Handling**: Implement comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms
3. **Real-time Optimization**: Optimize for real-time performance with proper timing guarantees
4. **Hardware Integration**: Properly integrate with real sensors and actuators
5. **Calibration**: Use real sensor calibration data, not default parameters
6. **Testing**: Conduct extensive testing in controlled environments
7. **Expert Review**: Have robotics experts review and validate your implementation

### CONTACT

For questions about safety considerations or proper implementation practices, consult with qualified robotics engineers and safety professionals.
